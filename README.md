# Visualizing Pandas
Create a summary of DataFrames using Matplotlib

---

## Overview of Analysis
Using my Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, I created a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, I made a multiple-line graph that showed the total weekly fares for each city type. The data used came from datasets provided by PyBer, a ride-sharing company, and the code used to make the summary DataFrame and graph is saved in [PyBer_Challenge.ipynb](PyBer_Challenge.ipynb).  

## Results
The PyBer summary DataFrame and the multiple-line chart showed the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. 

### PyBer Summary DataFrame
Looking at the total rides and total drivers columns we can see that unsurprisingly urban cities have the most riders and drivers, and rural cities have the fewest. Though, the most intriguing result is that urban cities have the cheapest average ride fare, with rural having the most. The cost of the average fare seems to be proportional to how populated a city is; the more populated a city, the cheaper the cost of a PyBer ride.

### Multiple-Line Chart
A graph of the total fares by city type shows that the most profitable cities are urban, then suburban, and rural being the least. These results are consistent across the graph, with minor discrepancies over time.

## Summary
Three business recommendations I have to address any disparities among the city types are as follows:
1. I would look to appeal the most to urban cities because they make up the most riders and drivers.  
2. Increasing the number of users of PyBer in rural areas wouldn't hurt since those areas have the highest average fare price.  
3. And finally, I would recommend spending the bulk of advertising in urban areas, as they are more populated and bring in the most money.
